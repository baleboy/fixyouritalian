    <h4>What is this all about?</h4>

    <p>We are a group of Italian citizens concerned about the way our language is mistreated around the world. We cringe at the sight of the words "bruscetta" and "spagetti". It hurts us so much that we are willing to fix it for free.</p>

    <h4>What's in it for you?</h4>

    <p>We don't want your money and we won't do anything with your email address. We just want our beautiful language to be treated with respect. If you use our services and are happy with them, we would love to quote you on our website, but that's all.</p>

    <h4>Why should I trust you?</h4>

    <p>Yeah, we get that. How do you know we aren't sneaking swearwords or political statements in your restaurant's list? Frankly, you don't. We hope that over time people who have used the service will testify that it's reliable.</p>

    <h4>Can you translate my menu?</h4>

    <p>Sorry but no, you should get your translation elsewhere and we'll fix it for you. Obviously translators around the world aren't doing a great job, because we haven't yet seen a menu that wouldn't have a mistake.</p>

    <h4>Will you fix anything else than a restaurant menu?</h4>

    <p>If it's not too long, sure.</p>

    <h4>Alright, you convinced me. Let's do it!</h4>

    <p>Great! Push the button below to get started.</p>
